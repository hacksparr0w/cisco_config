`cisco_config` is a Python implementation of a robust parsing algorithm
capable of reliably loading and exporting the Cisco Configuration file format.
The module includes a low-level parsing toolkit alongside an extensive library
of predefiend, high-level utilities and presets tailored to specific Cisco
products, such as Cisco ASA.
